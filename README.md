# ðŸ“˜ Notes-U â€” A Simple Notes Sharing Site for Our Class

Notes-U is a lightweight web project made to help our class upload, organize, and access notes easily.  
Itâ€™s designed for simplicity â€” just choose your year, semester, subject, and upload or download materials. Thatâ€™s it!

This is mostly for fun, practice, and hopefully a bit of actual use. ðŸ˜„

## ðŸ”§ Current Features

- Clean and responsive UI
- Category layout: Year / Semester / Subject

## ðŸš€ Coming Soon (Hopefully!)

Mostly built as a side project for:
- Sharing notes with classmates more easily
- Trying out Firebase + Tailwind
- Learning to build a useful tool from scratch
